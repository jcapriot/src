  Export Restriction Disclaimer:
  We believe that CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x is a low technology product that does
  not appear on the Department of Commerce CCL list of restricted exports.
  Accordingly, we believe that our product meets the qualifications of
  an ECCN (export control classification number) of EAR99 and we believe
  it fits the qualifications of NRR (no restrictions required), and
  is thus not subject to export restrictions of any variety.

  Approved Reference Format:
  In publications, please refer to SU as per the following example:

xRubberBox assumes that event is a ButtonPress event for the 1st button;
i.e., it tracks motion of the pointer while the 1st button is down, and
it sets x, y, w, and h and returns after a ButtonRelease event for the
1st button.

Before calling xRubberBox, both ButtonRelease and Button1Motion events
must be enabled. >*/
