  Export Restriction Disclaimer:
  We believe that CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x is a low technology product that does
  not appear on the Department of Commerce CCL list of restricted exports.
  Accordingly, we believe that our product meets the qualifications of
  an ECCN (export control classification number) of EAR99 and we believe
  it fits the qualifications of NRR (no restrictions required), and
  is thus not subject to export restrictions of any variety.

/*< Rasterize a float array as wiggle-trace-variable-area.

The raster coordinate of the (top,left) bit in the image is (0,0).
In other words, x increases downward and y increases to the right.
Raster scan lines run from left to right, and from top to bottom.
Therefore, xfirst, xlast, yzmin, and yzmax should not be less than 0.
Likewise, yzmin and yzmax should not be greater than nbpr*8-1, and
care should be taken to ensure that xfirst and xlast do not cause bits
to be set outside (off the bottom) of the image.

Variable area fill is performed on the right-hand (increasing y) side
of the wiggle.  If yzmin is greater than yzmax, then z values between
zmin will be plotted to the right of zmax, and z values between zbase
and zmin are filled.  Swapping yzmin and yzmax is an easy way to
reverse the polarity of a wiggle.

The variable "endian" must have a value of 1 or 0. If this is
not a case an error is returned. >*/

           Fixed bug in computing yoffset.  Previously, when zmin==zmax
           the rasterized trace was shifted to the left by one trace.
MODIFIED:  Paul Michaels, Boise State University, 29 December 2000
           Added solid/grey color scheme, wiggle=2 option for peaks/troughs
