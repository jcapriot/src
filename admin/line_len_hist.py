'''
Outputs histogram with line length in Madagascar source code base for one type of file,
OR names of files which contains line longer than a given threshold

Line length does not include the newline character
Trailing whitespaces at the end of a line are not considered

Call this program from the upper directory (RSFSRC), i.e.:
    ./adm/line_len_hist.py ext=[py/c/cc/m/f90/f/txt] [pflt=<positive integer>] >results.asc

ext=py will also scan SConstruct files in book/ , (and nothing else in book/).
Other extensions will only go through source code directories.

pflt stands for "Print Files with Lines longer Than"
If a pflt value is specified, a list of filenames will be given
If no pflt is specified, output will have two columns: line length, nr of occurences
