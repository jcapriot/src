'''
Finds in how many projects each Madagascar program is used.
Can be run anywhere, with no arguments.
I.e. "./document.py >results.asc"
will produce something like
"sfbyte is used in 568 projects
    clip is not documented
    scalebar is not documented
    gpow is not documented
etc..."
Note: private projects are also included
